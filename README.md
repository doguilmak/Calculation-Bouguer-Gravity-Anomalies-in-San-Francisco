## Project Statement

The aim of the project is to plot 3D **free-air anomalies, topography, bouguer correction and bouguer anomalies around San Francisco** with MATLAB. **NAD83 coordinates** used in this project.

For a more detailed explanation, please review the **Presentation.pdf** file.

## Definitions

### What is free-air anomaly?

In geophysics, the free-air gravity anomaly, often simply called the free-air anomaly, is the measured gravity anomaly after a free-air correction is applied to correct for the elevation at which a measurement is made. The free-air correction does so by adjusting these measurements of gravity to what would have been measured at a reference level. For Earth, this reference level is commonly taken as the mean sea level.

### What is topography?

Topography is the study of the shape and features of land surfaces. The topography of an area could refer to the surface shapes and features themselves, or a description (especially their depiction in maps).
Topography is a field of geoscience and planetary science and is concerned with local detail in general, including not only relief but also natural and artificial features, and even local history and culture. This meaning is less common in the United States, where topographic maps with elevation contours have made "topography" synonymous with relief.
Topography in a narrow sense involves the recording of relief or terrain, the three-dimensional quality of the surface, and the identification of specific landforms. This is also known as geomorphometry. In modern usage, this involves generation of elevation data in digital form (DEM). It is often considered to include the graphic representation of the landform on a map by a variety of techniques, including contour lines, hypsometric tints, and relief shading.

### What is bouger anomaly?

In geodesy and geophysics, the Bouguer anomaly (named after Pierre Bouguer) is a gravity anomaly, corrected for the height at which it is measured and the attraction of terrain. The height correction alone gives a free-air gravity anomaly.
Simple reduction: The gravitational acceleration outside a Bouguer plate is perpendicular to the plate and towards t, with magnitude 2πG times the mass per unit area, where is the gravitational constant. It is independent of the distance to the plate (as can be proven most simply with Gauss's law for gravity, but can also be proven directly with Newton's law of gravity). The value of is 6.67 × 10−11 N m2 kg−2, so is 4.191 × 10−10 N m2 kg−2 times the mass per unit area. Using 1 Gal = 0.01 m s−2 (1 cm s−2) we get 4.191 × 10−5 mGal m2 kg−1 times the mass per unit area. For mean rock density (2.67 g cm−3) this gives 0.1119 mGal m−1.
